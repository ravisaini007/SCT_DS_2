# 🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset

An end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the historical Titanic dataset, exploring passenger demographics, socio-economic factors, and their impact on survival outcomes. This analysis uses Python for data wrangling, visualization, and interpretation to reveal key survival trends.

## 1.📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to uncover insights from the Titanic dataset — identifying which factors influenced passenger survival rates such as gender, age, class, and embarkation port.
Through statistical summaries and rich visualizations, the project provides a clear picture of passenger distribution and survival probabilities.

## 2.🎯 Objectives

Explore and understand the structure of the Titanic dataset.

Handle missing values and clean the dataset effectively.

Perform Univariate and Bivariate Analysis to identify key survival patterns.

Visualize relationships between Age, Fare, Sex, Pclass, and Survival.

Derive meaningful insights using data visualization and statistical interpretation.

## 3.🧰 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning & manipulation

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib – Static visualizations

Seaborn – Statistical & categorical plots

Plotly – Interactive visualizations

## 4.🗂️ Dataset

Source: Titanic Dataset (titanic.csv)
Features include:

PassengerId, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch
Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
Pclass – Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Survived – Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 5.📊 Analysis & Visualizations

⚓ Survival Distribution (Pie Chart)

👩‍🦰 Passenger Count by Gender

🎂 Age and Fare Distribution

💺 Survival by Passenger Class

🧒 Age vs Survival Density Plot

🌍 Embarkation Town vs Survival

⚡ Correlation Heatmap

🧭 Interactive Scatter (Age vs Fare vs Survival) using Plotly

Each visualization reveals patterns in survival rates across different passenger categories.

## 6.💡 Key Insights

✅ Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

✅ First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to third-class.

✅ Higher fares and younger ages slightly increased chances of survival.

✅ Passengers from Port ‘C’ (Cherbourg) had better survival outcomes.

✅ Strong correlation observed between Pclass, Fare, and Survival.

## 7.📈 Business & Analytical Impact

This project demonstrates the ability to:

• Perform end-to-end data exploration and cleaning.

• Generate meaningful insights from historical datasets.

• Visualize survival trends and interpret feature importance.

• Use Python’s analytics libraries for effective data storytelling.
